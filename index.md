My name is Zvonimir Rakamaric (spelled Rakamarić in Croatian)  and I am a
associate professor in the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/) at
the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). Prior to this, I was a
postdoctoral fellow in the [Robust Software Engineering
Group](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/rse/) at [NASA Ames Research
Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames). I received my Ph.D. and M.Sc. from the
Department of Computer Science at the [University of British
Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), and my supervisor was [Alan
Hu](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ajh/). I grew up and did my undergrad in Croatia.

### Research Mission

My research mission is to improve the reliability and resilience of complex
software systems by empowering developers with practical tools and techniques
for analysis of their artifacts.

### Research Interests

My research interests are pragmatic. I am interested in any technique or method
that supports my research mission, including but not limited to: [extended
static checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_static_checking),
[automated theorem
proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), [model
checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking), and [runtime
verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification). Currently,
my emphasis is on highly automatic and scalable analysis techniques for
software, in particular for concurrent software.

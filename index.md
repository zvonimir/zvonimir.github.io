I am a principal applied scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Before, I was an associate professor
in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, where
I led the Software Analysis Research
Laboratory ([SOARlab](http://soarlab.org)). My work aims to improve the
reliability and resilience of complex systems (artificial intelligence, software, operating systems, etc.) by empowering developers
with practical tools and techniques for analysis of their artifacts.  To
achieve this, my research spans multiple areas, including automated reasoning,
programming languages, software engineering, and security.

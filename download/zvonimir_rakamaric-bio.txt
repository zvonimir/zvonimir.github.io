Zvonimir Rakamaric is a principal applied scientist at Amazon Web Services
(AWS) working on problems in the intersection of artificial intelligence and
automated reasoning.  Before, he was an associate professor in the School of
Computing at the University of Utah, where he led the Software Analysis
Research Laboratory (SOARlab).  Prior to this, Zvonimir was a postdoctoral
fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, where he worked closely
with researchers from the Robust Software Engineering Group at NASA Ames
Research Center to improve the coverage of testing of NASA's flight critical
systems. Zvonimir received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the
University of Zagreb, Croatia; he obtained his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the
Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, Canada.

Zvonimir's research mission is to improve the reliability and resilience of
complex systems (artificial intelligence, software, operating systems, etc.) by
empowering developers with practical tools and techniques for analysis of their
artifacts.  He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award 2016, Microsoft Research
Software Engineering Innovation Foundation (SEIF) Award 2012, Microsoft
Research Graduate Fellowship 2008-2010, Silver Medal in the ACM Student
Research Competition at the 32nd International Conference on Software
Engineering (ICSE) 2010, and the Outstanding Student Paper Award at the 13th
International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and
Analysis of Systems (TACAS) 2007. He is also an IEEE Senior Member.
